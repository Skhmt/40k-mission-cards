## Instructions on how to print

1. Go to:  https://www.printplaygames.com/product/poker-cards/

2. For the "Print" dropdown, choose "Print Double Sided"

3. For the "Paper Stock" dropdown, choose "Matte Premium Black Core" for ~$5 per 18 cards or "Synthetic Paper (waterproof)" for ~$8 per 18 cards. The Synthetic Paper cards CAN be used with dry erase markers, but will require Windex or some other chemical to remove the dry erase marker. Personally I'd just get the Matte Premium Black Core and spend the $6 you save to buy real sleeves that don't require any chemicals to remove the dry erase marks.

4. For "File Upload FRONT" upload "mission-front.jpg"

5. For "File Upload Back" upload "mission-back.jpg"

6. Select Quantity (1, unless you want multiple copies)

7. Click "Add To Cart"

For Secondaries, repeat all the steps, but upload "secondaries-front.jpg" and "secondaries-back.jpg". 

If you want the Sisters-specific secondaries, blessings of the faithful, and sacred rites, repeat all the steps, but upload "sisters-front.jpg" and "sisters-back.jpg".

After you've added all your sets of cards, just check out as normal.

I don't make any money off of this. You can do what you want, but if you want to sell these, you have to change the art on the card backs.
